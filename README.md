# Pepp.reviews website

Simple site but wanted something if people wanted to look me up. Also it's kinda nice
it automatically updates the videos I release.

Also, it's my first rust program and I wanted to dip my toes in with
a real project but a simple one. It was fun!

## Future

If I was really smart this would output a simple static page that chron
could update every night. Then it could be served simply by nginx.
