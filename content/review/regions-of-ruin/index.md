Regions of Ruin attempts to combine so many game ideas. Base building, node exploration, combat, and crafting just to name a few. You won't be doing to same thing for very long, the game has you switching context so many times. Initial this is tedious but as the game grows , and you have more to do, it's enough to hold your attention. Regions of Ruin held my attention for way longer than I expected. So while the game has issues, like pacing, there's still enough here for a compelling game loop.

At the onset you're a small group of dwarves trying to rebuild what you once had. You're seriously a shadow of your former selves. So you start with a small village with only a few inhabitants. Your goal is to find more dwarves to join the cause, collect resources, and kick goblin ass.

The main game loop is uncovering nodes on the map. Then visiting those nodes and chatting up the local dwarves or fighting some goblins. The more of these nodes you clear the more resources your dwarves can harvest from the land. You get to assign them to the nodes to pick how many resources are coming in. Your stockpiles grow and pretty soon your ready to add a tavern or a library.

I like how the game still collects resources as you take over other nodes, it doesn't draw it out for no reason. The collection rate is quick enough that by the time you clear a few nodes you can work on your town. This is what I mean about the game loop. It constantly has something for you to do. At first going back to town is a chore just to heal up but later on you can recruit dwarves to your team and collect gold from your tavern. Or buy and sell weapons that make you much more powerful.

Anyway, let's dive a little deeper into the nodes. They are very small areas usually with combat. Sometime there are friendlies there which give out quests or perhaps you can recruit them. One of the issues with the game is that you have to load each of these nodes and it can really add up. As I said before early on you'll be visiting your home quite often which leads to seeing many of these loading screens. It slows the game down so much and I was quite bored. It is better when you can hit a few nodes before returning but still I wish these loads were a lot shorter.

Also some of them have platforming which is not great. The controls and movement are not precise enough and so it feels rough. You'll skip on a few edges and have to redo the whole thing. It's the late game larger ruins where it really gets frustrating. Large gaps in the architecture can easily cause a mistake. Luckily the game doesn't ask you to preform any of this while in combat!

While Regions of Ruin does a good job leading you on a journey, it could have done better. It's cool when you talk to someone and they give you a bit of information to investigate. It brings out the mystery of the world. A good example of the are the ruins. It starts off a small mystery and becomes a long running quest. I like what's here but they could have taken it further. They missed a huge opportunity to explore the history of the world. Not only am I bringing back the dwarves but learning about their rich history, which the game sets up. They instead wasted all the quests on killing goblins. Which I was going to do anyway.

Anywho, the town building is simple. Spend resources and now you have the building, that's fine. It's only important as to make sure you have a selection of weapons to buy every time you go back to town.

They are two interesting buildings though.

Build a tavern and you can recruit men. Hiring these sell swords is expensive so it's a late game mechanic. Also they can die easily, especially if it's a mage. That can mean a quick \$1k gold down there shitter. One stray fucking fireball and _poof_, their gone. It's why I suggest only hiring the beefiest, most hardened, dwarven warriors with you. They do make the fights easier so it's worth it but the mechanic could be a lot smoother.

Build an enchanting table and you can enchant weapons. But, it's useless. It's utterly confusing. Each piece of armor can only be enchanted so much but the way it's displayed to the player is unclear. It took me forever to realize there was a problem and I'm not afraid to admit I looked it up in the steam forums. Sad part is the good it's you get are already enchanted to holy hell and it's good enough. Why would I spend time trying to money with enchanting when the gear I have is awesome?! You can easily ignore enchanting and finish the game. Super lame! An entire mechanic wasted.

You know what else isn't required? Bandages and health potions. If you play carefully and slow there's no way you'll be in any danger. Your health regenerates so complete a fight, back off, and then wait for it to come back. You can acquire quite a few injuries before it's detrimental and it seems they don't actually kill you. Although it can be difficult to predict as the health bar isn't a typical bar but some bit of text that's difficult to translate into a health bar. You'll get the hang of it though. All I'm saying is that the game lets you cheese it a bit which is fine since the point isn't the combat.

Side note, you do want to play with a keyboard. Although it is possible to play with a controller a lot of the smaller mechanics, like the map, will be easier on a keyboard.

Anyway, by the time the end game rolled around I was a literal god. Nothing could stop me! Although the poison sure did slow me down which sucked. I knew I wasn't going to die but now I was going to do it at half the speed! With the end game items I was so tanky I wasn't afraid of anything and my hammer would smash through all the enemies. It was kinda sad how the game started off so strong and got me hooked but it didn't last. Yet, I did keep playing, a testament to how good the core game loop is.

Overall, Regions of Ruin is fun and I like it but it's just OK. There's so many loading screens with the uneven gameplay. Who doesn't want to liberate and build up a dwarven culture? It's a strong base which is why I'm interested to hear they're making a sequel. I believe with what they learned here they'll be able to deliver something better.
