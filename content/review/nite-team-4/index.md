As a computer nerd NITE Team 4 raising a few questions quickly, "did they just say that?" "Did they just subtly mention Kevin Mitnick?" "Did they just explain DNS to me?" The answer was yes to all of these questions. I was hooked! This is some real nerdy shit. Obvious the developer behind this game knows their stuff. So I was super hyped right from the start.

If I was going to describe NITE Team 4 I would say that it's, "Basically typing into a terminal". I'm sure the next question they would have is, "How is that fun?" If you have to ask then the game is probably not for you. Because the game is a blast. NITE Team 4 doesn't feel like the same tedium I usually feel with games that are too much like programming. Those have trouble keeping my attention. My thoughts are that if I wanted to program I would actually program. But being a ridiculously good hacker? That's a power fantasy!

However, NITE Team 4 starts with an extended job training sequence that could also be described as a tutorial. In which you gain practice using all your hacking tools, terminals, and data. While the game doesn't force you to play all the training you'll be confused while playing and won't get far without it. If ever there was a required tutorial, this is it. There are so many different hacking tools available and knowing which one does what is important. They're all for a specific type of data. Like how you use the DNS & Vhost Mapping tool if you only have a domain name or you use Air Crack tool if you have the target's daily schedule.

If you're anything like me then I got a bit bored as they feed me the commands. It's not even how I learn at work. I enjoy getting my hands dirty right away and making mistakes. What I will say is that the voice acting and overall polish of the training keeps it entertaining. Also if you're impatient as I am and rush to the first mission you can complete it without finishing all the training. I also found out that you can pause a mission, go to the required training and come back if you're lost.

Nonetheless, I'm finding that they did a great job with the interface, it works like a real computer. You can tab through the multiple command line windows you have open, tab through fields, tab completion, and type exit to close a window. Maybe you don't know but a lot of these games either don't take the time to get it right or have no idea. I can one hundred percent tell the developers wanted to make the interface comfortable for people who use computers. The nailed it. Hell, you even get more workspaces to organize with. The only thing missing is being able to resize the windows but that would have been difficult for them to make them responsive considering how stylized they are.

Anyway, there are four main missions in the game and the story is interesting. I enjoy how much they let you figure it out on your own. Especially after doing the training you're more than ready to solve the puzzle yourself. There are a few hints dropped but for the most part by the second missions you're using all the tools you've learned on your own. And no doubt about it this is a puzzle game. You'll sometimes only start with a person's name, then you need to find the domain name, and then find a way to hack into their system. You get the picture. While there's only so many tools in the game I found more uses for them than I expected. You won't use them in the same order. Starting with a domain doesn't guarantee that's the final domain you'll use.

What really make the missions great is how much voice acting, content, and attention to detail went into them. The writing is good too and I got super into it. Learning about the tools and using them is rewarding when you figure out the puzzle on your own. Also infiltrating a group of hackers made me feel like a bad ass. I love being good with computers.

Side note, NITE Team 4 has some fantastic audio controls. They let you rewind the audio and show the text in screen. It's great!

That's only where the content begins though. There's open world missions, bounties, and the hivemind network. The last one, the hivemind network, is the area with user created missions and they're super intense. Most of them will require you to search outside the game for information. One of them even asks you to send emails to a gmail account which is a little weird. I gave it a shot and it's obviously an auto response account which looks like it keeps going deeper. So if you like games that ask for you to do outside research, here it is! This long running content really adds a ton to the game. I'm amazed it's here!

I also started one of the open world missions and it's equally as hard. Although more polished than the hivemind. You're given a report with minimal information and links to do real research. This is a bit different from the normal content. Instead of infiltrating a group it takes a lot more research and work. This seems a lot more like a real job which could be appealing to many people but not really my style. I expect this would be a lot easier with backup like in the story missions. So maybe get a partner to play with.

Keep in mind there is a multiplayer mode here but it's in beta so expect bugs. Two minds are always better than one. Right now it only works for the story mode and the hivemind network.

So who is NITE Team 4 not going to work for? That's easy! If you hate typing into a console or a game without graphics then steer clear.

Also avoid if you think you'll get bored waiting for all the terminals to stop running. This has a real time component to it. You have to wait for the computer to brute Force passwords just like in real life. I noticed you can crank up the password tool so it could potentially take half an hour! That never happens in the story mode though.

Overall, NITE Team 4 is a fun experience and I loved it. Being a bad ass hacker is awesome and the amount of polish here is insane. There's also plenty of content now even though I would like to see the roadmap. But if I had to guess, I'm going to say they're going to keep adding new content. Which is exciting. So crank up some appropriate music and get hacking!
