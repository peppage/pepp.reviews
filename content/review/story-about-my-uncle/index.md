This is enjoyable the moment the narrator starts speaking. A tale about a crazy journey to follow uncle Fred. That guy is a bit of a scientist!

It's a narrative focused game. Learning about Fred and following the main character on their journey was enjoyable. We're not breaking new ground with twists and turns here, it's a simple story. You enjoy it mostly from the narrator's point of view, the main character. But also get some outside perspective as he tells the story.

The mechanics are good most of the time. There are a few instances where it can be frustrating if you're stuck. What happens is that you'll misjudge the momentum and slam your head into a rock. Then you wait as you plummet to your death and have to start over. The fall is the problem, I wish the game restarted quicker. You'll almost never be able to actually save a fall. At least the checkpoints are close. And this is nitpicking because the game is so short it doesn't matter.

Overall, A Story About My Uncle is good, and I liked it. I can't believe this came out in 2014 and I missed it. This game has held up incredibly well. It's a nice short experience that I highly recommend.
