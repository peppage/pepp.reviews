To tell the truth, this isn't a game I expected to review. I've press play in Steam for Tanzia two times before this week and both times I quit about an hour in. But, after two years in early access it's finally being released. This comes after a huge rework to animations, combat, gems, and spells. So I really wanted to give it a serious go.

Well that sounds good enough but what it is? Oh, yeah... Tanzia is a single player RPG that relies heavily on story to keep the player engaged. The combat is a lot like Kingdoms of Amalur or World of Warcraft. It definitely makes me feel some old feels since I used to be a huge Warcraft player in college.

The similarities are numerous. Quests, patrolling mobs, random side quests, grinding, and crafting potions. You even purchase new spells to learn them! Really the only thing missing is question marks over the quest giver's head although I don't miss it. Tanzia does a great job explaining what you need to do next with comic book style cut scenes. These visions give you a little indication as to what's to come but you can also rely on your map most of the time. If you really want to get all the quests you'll actually have to talk to people.

Anyway, you'll be doing a lot of quests along side the main quest to level up and become stronger. There are collection and killing quests but also some new types which I appreciate. Although generally they all boil down to killing enemies. The one I liked was killing enemies on a certain point then reading a spell. The quests have you going around the small world of Tanzia along with a few islands.

And of course combat goes along with that too. It's a slow real time system where you have to wait for spell cool downs. While you wait you'll be swinging your staff. This is going to be where most players decide if they want to play Tanzia. At this point I find this style of combat rather slow and boring. I kited a lot of the enemies for a long time while I waited for the spell I wanted to use to come off cool down. I also took advantage of line of sight and pathing to keep the enemies off me. So it required a lot of waiting. Even more if you don't get any critical strikes which can swing a fight to your favor quite a bit.

Then, since there is no health or mana regen, I either had to run back to a healing totem or use potions. This is a bigger problem for me personally since I'm one of those players that likes to wait to use their potions. So if you're down to drink them all the time the game will be much easier. Also you're given plenty of materials to make the potions or gold to buy them.

There's also four different pieces of equipment you can get. Staff, head, body, and feet. All pretty basic upgrades and do make a big difference. Tanzia also has gems that you can place inside the staff to augment your character with more health or loot drops. It's a pretty basic system. The potion making is also basic. Collect the materials around the world and at a workbench you can make it.

But the game's main focus is the story. It's takes about five hours to complete and you're working on the main quest line almost the entire time. The story is simple though with no real surprises. However, not every story needs to have an epic twist to be good. Sometimes it's nice to have something right down the middle of the plate and wholesome. Although if someone described to me as uninteresting I'm not sure I would be able to convince them otherwise.

Anyway, even though Tanzia delivers the story quickly it still falls into the same trap as many other games with side quests. You know what I mean? Where there's impending doom that's an emergency but could you possibly take some time to take care of some turtles for me, I'll give you some cash. Tanzia knows it's doing this, literally chores, but I'm not sure that makes it any better. I still had to let out the heavy sigh.

I have to mention a weird mechanic that stuck out, probably because of my previous Warcraft experience. Enemies will not stop chasing you once you've attacked them. You can get really far away but until you leave the zone they will be chasing you. It can lead to some pretty funny situations where I had an entire area of enemies following me. It was a crazy mob train of spiders! So I popped over to the next area quick and they were gone.

For some good news they fixed another issue I had where you would lose all your quest progression if you left the zone or died after saving. So if you have previously played Tanzia and were as annoyed as I was then you don't have to worry now. When it shows that it's saving it's actually saving. It was very misleading before. On a previous build of the game is really screwed me when I was the last item of a quest. Although this makes the game a lot easier.

Overall, Tanzia is fine. I'm glad they polished it up a bit before the final release because it really shows. I'm also glad they added in a turbo mode for someone that doesn't like to go slow. While I don't really enjoy this style of combat I think others will enjoy Tanzia.
