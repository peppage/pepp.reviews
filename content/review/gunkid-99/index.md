summary: "Gunkid 99 takes a page right out of Super Crate Box's book but it's better in almost every way. The free movement gives a lot of power to the player which can lead to some crazy close calls. Also there's a ton of weapons which keep the gameplay fresh."

Hey, I saw this game being made on Reddit! Each time the developer posted it was about adding a new weapon to the game. They were taking feedback and the gifs really showed off the game. That's pretty cool and it's nice to see that it's finally released.

Gunkid 99 is inspired by Super Crate Box by Vlambeer. If you don't know that's a game about picking up crates with random weapons inside. When you die you're scored by how many of those crates you collected. Well Gunkid 99 is very similar mechanically. Which is great, since I liked Super Crate Box so much. But, there are differences.

The goal of each level is the same, collect as many guns as you can. But the first time you play a level there is a limit and you just need to finish. This unlocks a different mode and the next level.

Now, I have a problem with this. I wonder why I'm restricted the first time through. I sorta understand why a certain score would unlock the next level but why should the game stop me? What if I'm on an amazing run? Nope, doesn't matter, your kicked out. Having to go back through and pick up the first twenty guns again hurts. It adds to the fatigue of playing and doesn't make me actually want to go for the high score. There's only so many times you can redo the slow parts of a level to get to the good stuff.

Anyway, the game play is exciting. I really enjoy getting to the limits of my abilities. With a ton of enemies on the screen, barely getting the new weapon in time. Also the movements mechanics are really well done. Having that wall slide and double jump makes a huge difference in giving the player a lot of freedom and power. Oh yeah, to make it more exciting Gunkid 99 adds a timer and you're forced to pick up a new gun before it runs out. This is a great addition and forces the player to be aggressive. Then when you have to make that close call it can be exhilarating when you nail it.

Gunkid 99 has a lot of staying power too. Since you're given so many movement abilities the levels can get really complicated. There are even traps and lava pits you have to watch out for. Also there seems to be a huge variety of guns and I keep unlocking more. Even though I've seen the gifs on Reddit I'm still surprised there are so many. I especially like the void gun. Powerful but tough to use without hurting yourself. So far I've unlocked about twelve guns and I expect there to be even more. There's also a variety of items. For example one gives you double damage after picking up a weapon and another creates an explosion around a weapon pickup. Very smartly they included items that will block certain guns from dropping. Great if there's one that you particularly hate, but it will take a slot from another item and you can only equip three. Do note that items work in either game mode.

Here's the loadout screen. On the left is what I have equipped, three different items and weapons. While weapons only work on the other game mode items work in both. I prefer the upgrades that increase damage rather than the magnet or coin. You unlock more weapons and items in the shop. The gun blocks are interesting and stop a gun from being dropped at all but I'm not sure why you would want to take an item slot for them.

And speaking of the other game mode... While the main game is about collecting weapons and constantly dealing with what random gun you get the other mode lets you select three guns that will drop. During that mode only those three guns will ever spawn. The game is generous and whatever mode has a higher score for the level goes towards your total. But they do have separate leaderboards which is fair, so that's good.

Another grievance I have which is the total high score that's required to continue to the next area. It's not enough to complete all the levels in a zone, no no no. You have to get to an arbitrary high score collectively across all the levels in the zone. This is particularly annoying as someone who wants to play more of the game without competing for a high score. Hell, I'm struggling to finish some of these levels. The game is pretty difficult already and limiting me from playing more of the game does what? I like going for high scores but I'll do it on my own time. Is this to force people to populate the high score table? I don't know but it's brutal.

This is the level select screen, there's seven levels in world one and two. I can assume that throughout the rest of the five worlds there will also be seven levels. They're very diverse, it gives you a little screenshot of it when you select it. And the total high score is really the problem here. The number is right there in your face and I can't imagine trying to reach that. It's really quite difficult. You can select between the two modes here and yes the Steam leaderboards are on this screen as well.

Overall, Gunkid 99 is fun and I like it. I don't understand the locked content and am sad I'm blocked from seeing the rest of the game. Do know that it's better than Super Crate Box. I went and installed that game after playing Gunkid 99 and whew. Super Crate Box feels old now. But, there's a demo available for Gunkid 99 so give it a shot. It's more difficult and more diverse and I'm happy about that.
