Games like Tacoma sure got a bad reputation when they first came out. But since they've become more accepted into the mainstream the quality has gone up considerably! Tacoma is an experience to be had and if you enjoyed What Remains of Edith Finch then you'll enjoy Tacoma too.

To start, the game looks good. The atmosphere of the space station is perfect. It feels completely plausible for the future. I can only imagine how much time they put into placing all these little objects around. Items like food and books all the way down to different toothbrushes in each of the crew's bathrooms.

All those details have a purpose. To give you a sense of who these people were and what the hell happened in this space station. You see, it's completely empty. You only experience what happened through augmented reality. Upon entering an area where playback is available you can start it up and not only listen to the crew's conversation but also see their movements. I enjoyed seeing the characters act naturally. One might be chatting to the station's AI while playing pool and others might be recording a report. You can follow each before they come together for a group conversation. It feels so normal. It's much better than an audio log, we've come a long way since Dear Esther.

It's Tacoma's greatest accomplishment. I can easily describe the different crew members and their personalities. That this is so much more than listening to people chat.

That said, it IS a walking simulator. If you don't want to experience a story well then Tacoma isn't going to change your mind. I would recommend What Became of Edith Finch over Tacoma too. That was more unique and had interesting mechanics. Tacoma is a little on the bland side and the story is unique but not mind blowing. It definitely hits on a few topics that could potentially be coming up for humans in the future. It doesn't try and fork the topic in your eye which I appreciate. Feeds into the natural feeling of the game.

Overall, Tacoma is good and I liked it. The voyeur way you can watch the crew makes it unique. It doesn't drag on either and the rewind system means it doesn't waste your time re-watching the crew. If you like these types of games you'll like Tacoma too.
