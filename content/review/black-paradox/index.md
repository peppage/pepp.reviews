I've played a bunch of games like Black Paradox because of this YouTube channel. There's so many of them and most of them are terrible or don't bring anything new. I give up on them quickly and don't even bother to show them to you . Why waste any of our time?

So, if I'm making this video on Black Paradox then you've already guessed that I think there's something here to consider. Well there is! It's pretty good although simplistic. I mean c'mon it even has a DeLorean as the ship.

Black Paradox has all the basics covered. Plenty of enemies, bosses, weapons, and upgrades. Enough to keep each run unique. They spent their time in early access adding new content which is great! If you're wondering about the name of the game it's your name. But it's also your special move! You can call on a clone of yourself that shoots a random weapon, it comes it pretty damn handy.

Anyway, the game loop is exactly what you expect. Play through a side scrolling schmup with a boss at the end. The background of the level changes and enemies can come in from all sides. Each level will have one weapon you can choose to collect. You'll find that some are better than others. Like the rail gun which isn't that helpful, takes too long to charge. While the corrosive gun is fun because the blast will hit and corrode other enemies. Or how about the radius gun which is difficult to use since it shoots in the direction you moved last. It's nice that the game let's you carry two at a time. I found having one for levels and one for bosses works well. There's a bit of a balance issue though, the swarm gun is way too powerful! I hope that's something they'll fix.

Keep in mind, it's the same format for each level but increases in difficulty. Especially that third boss, he's a real son of a bitch.

After you finish off the boss there are two rewards. First you collect a bounty that goes towards your overall funds. These bounties increase as the bosses get more difficult. You also can select between two upgrades that last for the run. They're all passive which is disappointing. It keeps the game more simple than it could be. There's no risks you can take to make the game more difficult for a reward.

Luckily there are a lot of drones because I find them to be delightful. There's laser, machine gun, and repair drones. It's like adding in extra firepower without even expending any thought. Although if I was going to pick, Nova Drift has a much more exciting upgrade system.

Well, that's that. You'll end up repeating the first few levels a couple times to build up your cash. Which you spend on global upgrades. These upgrades are what makes Black Paradox stand out from some of those other games. You visit the garage where you can place chips into the car. At the start you can only slot two but you'll quickly buy two more slots for a total of four. These span from giving your car a shield or sometimes shooting behind you. So they each have a special skill and stats. These kinds of improvements make it a lot easier to get further in the game. They're all passive though and it feels like on a long enough timeline you'll be powerful. Black Paradox lands squarely in the "grind to win" category. Which is fine if you know what you're getting into.

It does get a little frustrating when the shop only has lower quality chips. I can't figure out when the stock changes. Before coming out of early access there wasn't even an option to cycle the stock. Now that there is it's better but the chips that appear are sometimes SO under powered I don't see the point. There's too much of a chance you'll get to the shop and not find anything. Even after you cycle. It's also annoying when you cycle it to find a chip you want but now you're short on funds. There's going to be a lot of grinding to get a bank big enough to cycle the chips and be able to buy one. This wasn't the solution I was looking for.

Actually I want to stress that Black Paradox rewards playing the game a lot more than skill. Sure, getting deeper into a run will net you more money but if the chip you want to buy isn't there then the money sits there and feels like a waste. I can imagine a situation where I have a large bank and nothing to spend it on. But the more you play the more upgrades you'll see the higher your stats are and boom once you go over the edge you'll finish the game.

That's to say there's no real progression in the game. Black Paradox tries to mix an arcade feel with some randomization and it only works because there's so many weapons and upgrades. It's difficult to get excited about what I might come across in a run because I have no idea what's available. Also when trying out new upgrades they can pretty much ruin a run. I'm look at you powerup that I forget the name of but it reverses the controls but does make you more powerful. I wasn't prepared for that one. That said it still a lot of fun when you do find a weapon or upgrade, or when you get a new combination of them which makes you feel powerful.

Side note, I love how the asteroids can hit enemies as well. Always like to see a little bit of chaos in a game that can screw with the enemies too.

Overall, Black Paradox is fun and it's worth your time. It's a bit mindless but I find it hard to put down, especially because of the art and music. This review seems a bit more negative than I feel towards Black Paradox but I wanted to make sure and cover everything. The gameplay is solid, even if it's derivative of other games in the genre.
