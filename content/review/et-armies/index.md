Wow. E.T. Armies remindes me of the first person shooters of the early 2000s. With an absolutely bonkers story! Including a rough commander that has to get the job done as you play a rookie. Cliche as it can get. All these really dorky cutscenes with cheesy dialogue. And well... it's a train wreck. But sometimes you have to watch as it happens, the spectacle of it all.

I am in no way recommending anyone actually play E.T. Armies. Yet, I couldn't stop playing. I had to see what they would do next. And it just keeps going. There's a lot of cutscenes and that ending, HAHA. They even have a bad and good ending. I'm almost impressed.

E.T. Armies is one shooting gallery after the next. They areas are well designed and provide a lot of cover and angles but it's the same every time. Enemies will come from one side and you have to shoot them until they're done. Next room. It's extremely mindless. The shooting isn't that great either, pretty basic. Not bad but there's nothing here besides point and click. If there was better audio it might even be passable.

However, it's also janky. For example when an enemy is in an animation after they get hit with a bullet you can't shoot them again. The bullet goes right through them so you learn to wait. One of the achievements is to complete the game without missing a shot, holy shit that must be difficult. Also, you can get stuck in some places and the enemy AI is a wreck. They do exactly the same thing every time. Which is run directly at you and let you shoot them right in the face. The snipers will focus you and so the game can be quite difficult. If you don't have cover and there's two snipers you're dead.

Another way the game is difficult is the graphics. Actually, they don't look too bad overall. But you have little control over them and the developers went HAM. They put everything they could fit here.

Did you want the lights to shine brightly in your eyes as you try and shoot an enemy in the distance?

Did you want a crazy lens flare that is ever present?

Yeah well I didn't want either of those things and I tried a bunch of different settings. They didn't work. The developers also put rain and spots on the camera all the time. Even more junk to try and ignore as you shoot the enemies. It makes them very difficult to see and one of the most frustrating points of the game.

So what did the game get right? I mean everything... if you like bad films. At one point the gruff commander said "Nothing looks scary to me anymore." Oh he's seen it all eh? Of course!

They also made head shots matter which means if you're a good shot the shooting is better. And they have a teammate lead you through the game which I liked. Provided something more than a lone wolf I can defeat everyone attitude that's typical in these games. Gives it more character and gives you a minimal amount of help.

Overall, E.T. Armies is a mess. It takes about three hours to complete and it's one constant shooting gallery. I can't imagine anyone playing this for real. But that said I've played worse games. This is playable, there is shooting, and it's silly. How could anyone argue with that when it gets as low as a \$1.50? If you want a mindless first person shooter then you've found your match. But I might suggest you look around a little bit more.
