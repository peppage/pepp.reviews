summary: 'Striking visuals but lackluster controls hurt it badly. Your movement is restricted too! You must find the exact way the devs wanted you to progress through a section.'

While the visuals are striking there's something really missing from The King's Bird. They do all they can to make it look like a smooth experience in the trailer which is why I was hyped when I got it free on twitch prime. Flight - Flow - Freedom is the tagline they went with and while it's not incorrect I wouldn't tell you that's how The King's Bird plays.

Let's get the stunning visuals out of the way first. C'mon, it draws you right in! The pixel art has this great simple style that works. I love how the darker foreground stands in contrast against the brighter backgrounds. The trailing scarf is neat and makes it easy to see the character and their trail. It has a good windy effect on it.

However, The King's Bird fails to meet the controls that are required for a game like this. I keep sliding off platforms and it's frustrating. It's very difficult to replicate what you want to do, especially if it's a boost jump. It requires two button presses at the same time and sometimes they don't register. It's by far the most flagrant issue.

The gliding isn't as smooth as you would expect either, the turn radius is not great. You're going to be failing a section a few times as you figure out exactly how much gliding power you need. You'll also fail a lot trying many different movement abilities to figure out exactly which one the developer wanted you to use to get through a section. It seems even if you're doing great in a level you won't be able to get through it clean.

For comparison, in Super Meat Boy even though the game was fast and hard you might complete a level without a death. An insane triumph and a real rush.

Here in The King's Bird though I was constantly getting trapped in an area as I repeatedly slammed my head against the wall trying to determine what I had to do. Is it flying? No. OK... is it wall jump with a boost up? No. Well is it a boost jump with a small glide at the end? Yes? Finally.

There's too much freedom in movement and not enough leeway to allow you to choose your own path through. Makes me feel, blerg.

Side note, there are collectibles in the levels. They're just for fun but they're a light color on a light background. Which means they're impossible to see and I often accidentally collected them.

Overall, The King's Bird is fine but I'm meh on it. I don't really want to rail on the game. Sometimes when the game lets you jump around a bit more and transition to gliding it does feel good. It feels like some inexperience or time crunch led to the missteps. I wonder what a more casual game would have been like since the mechanics are fun and the visuals amazing. If I wasn't so pressured to complete a level and left to the freedom and flow.
