summary: "Cosmonator is an old school style schmup with an advanced upgrade system that makes the game fun! It's also great that you are locked into upgrades and can't collect them all. This way you have to make tough decisions and replay the game to see everything."

Looking to get a fix on something retro? Then perhaps you've found your game in Cosmonator. This is mainly an old school schmup with a complicated upgrade system that you might find enticing. It's not going to be too complicated for people who want to dive in. It's got two different currencies and multi-tier upgrade classifications so there's a lot going on. Keep in mind that just because something is complicated doesn't mean it's not fun. So, this upgrade system takes time to figure out but could be rewarding to the right player.

Right, let's start with the bullet hell part of the game. What you see is what you get. Enemies come from any side of the screen and with enough bullets you'll blow em up. It's basic. Cosmonator starts off slow but grows into what you would expect from something in the bullet hell genre. There's enough enemy variety to keep it interesting. I never felt bored and there always seems to be always something new. They did a great job pacing it out. Along with a bunch of different kinds of bullets you have to worry about the enemies themselves flying at you. Especially the kamikaze ones!

The main game mode is broken up into four chapters with a bunch of levels. Your goal is to complete the final level in each chapter. You do get to choose your own path but with very limited branching. The branches are only a variance of one, maybe two levels. But, there's also extra levels to provide rewards towards upgrades.

There's another mode, gauntlet, that's unlimited play. You can use it to grind rewards for basic upgrades. If you reach a certain goal then you'll be rewarded further with the more powerful upgrade currency. It is limited to only three of those though.

If you're going to get the most out of Cosmonator then you're going to want to play through multiple times. Either trying a new build or playing through at a higher difficulty.

So... about that ship upgrade system. Like I said it's complicated with two different currencies. Cash for simple upgrades which you'll get from playing any level. And gems, which are required for stronger upgrades. These come from more difficult levels, bosses, and the gauntlet.

In the first tier you'll find stuff like, shot power and shot spread. Pretty basic upgrades but they can be purchased with cash. Which is really easy to get and you can keep replaying levels to always get more. On a long enough timeline you'll end up getting them all.

In the second tier you'll find stuff like, armor, shields, and homing missiles. Bigger and more important upgrades that cost gems. This is where you need to make permanent decisions. These gems are a limited resource so you will not be able to get all the upgrades. It makes it more interesting and stresses me out. What if I choose wrong? Which is just me sweating it out if I should choose napalm missiles, chem missiles, or ion missiles! They all seem good though and the game does a great job explaining which one does. Although I wish I didn't have to select the option for it to tell me more about it. Some menus show the info right away while others show it in a popup.

Then we have spells. They're pretty cheap but I don't think you'll want them all. They cost energy to cast and that's a limited amount during gameplay. They can be upgraded and are one of the more powerful things you can put cash into early on.

That's not all either! I can't go into everything but there's drones, feats, and master upgrades. There's quite a lot to specialize into so of you though replaying the game sounded boring well I don't think that's going to be a problem.

As you spend points upgrading your ship the rank modifier goes down which cuts into your cash rewards. This is strange at first but seems to be setup so you can't keep replaying the same lower levels over and over again. As you play you'll have to rely on the level bonus to get the majority of your cash. Which makes sense but it's not the best way to show players. It feels like a global punishment, am I supposed to not upgrade the ship? I don't think so. It would have been a lot clearer to apply the penalty per level. Punish the player directly for playing older levels.

The system also lends itself to grinding. You can constantly complete levels for these cash upgrades so I figure that eventually you'll be very powerful. Although with the penalty it could take a very long time. Still, some players might be enticed to grind and that's lame. But I like how Cosmonator shows exactly how much you will receive from either finishing the level or the level bonus so you don't waste your time going for a small amount.

The schmup gameplay has some issues too. The biggest one are the pieces of debris you can shoot but your ship passes right through. To me this is a huge problem. Here I am dodging all this debris for no reason. Is it there only to block some of my bullets? It doesn't absorb enough to make a huge difference. Even worse is when you find out some of the debris does hurt you! This inconsistency makes it quite difficult as a player to not feel cheated.

I also felt wronged when enemies would fly into view from the bottom of the screen. There's no warning! A little screen indication would be nice.

Another issue I have is the ship explosions. It's minor but they're the same color as enemy bullets so you assume you have to avoid it but nope. It's perfect safe for you to fly through it. It makes sense but of you're going to throw a lot of bullets at me the game has to be as clear as possible.

Which I also had a problem with. Maybe this one is just me but I had a heck of a time seeing the tiny bullets on the star background. They're also difficult to see through my own bullets. I know the point of the game is to dodge more than shoot and I tried my best. I didn't do too bad though.

Overall, Cosmonator is good fun and I like it. The upgrade system is unique and provides a lot of depth to the game. The small issues I have will be easily overlooked if you can get into it. Especially considering the depth that's here for multiple play throughs.
