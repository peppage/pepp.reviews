Hahaha, yeah. What can you say about a game that the entire goal is to frustrate you. Was I frustrated? At times, sure! It's a lot like Getting Over It With Bennet Foddy. For his game the tagline is,

I created this game
for a certain kind of person
To hurt them.

That same mentality can be applied here, even if I don't know the developer's intentions. It's much more for that type of gamer, and the same kind of gamer that enjoyed Getting Over It.

Jump King is a lot like Getting Over It and there's no way I'm getting out of this review without comparing them a little. But, it's only spiritually similar. The controls make Jump King much easier to be reproducible. There's no slippage, you have plenty of time to line up your jump and prepare yourself. You're not fighting the controls but more yourself because the jump is variable you need to learn it by feeling. Getting Over It was much more about making mistakes with the difficult analog controls and overcoming that. Jump King has digital inputs so you really need to memorize positioning and jump power. I'm not saying that's easy though but after doing a jump one hundred times you do have a much better feeling for it.

Anyway, there are only three buttons in Jump King. Jump, Left, and Right. As I said the jump is variable depending on how long you hold it but there's an upper bounds that once hit the game forces you to jump. The more jumps you can setup so they're at max jump the better. That way you only need to memorize the position on the platform you need to stand. Remembering and hitting the exact jump power can be difficult. The platforms are spaced in all different ways and the jumping guy can hit his head which ruins any momentum you think you'll have for the jump. It's about precision because a little too much jump and you'll fly right over where you want to land.

Keep in mind that you can fall all the way back to start fairly easily. The game doesn't allow you to adjust in air so it's completely out of your control and no way to make an amazing save. The developers did put some safety along the way so once you get good enough falling becomes less. Even so, the higher you go they definitely wanted to leave the opportunity for you to fall completely. So you get better at calculating the jumps in a way to try and mitigate the fall but the devs know that and created some parts of the level that will take you all the way down.

Side note, the developers saw fit to leave out any music in the game. And for that I want to say thank you so much! While I can imagine Jump King with some 8-bit chip music I'm glad it's not there. When you need to get frustrated and play a game over and over trying to stick music in there can be difficult. It can become tedious to listen to. So, the subtle sounds of nature they have included are awesome. It can fade in and out of the background as I play without interfering in my concentration.

Overall Jump King is good at setting out what it wanted to do. Be a difficult game that will hurt you, if you let it. Being honest I only played about a half hour and I got to what seems to be the second section. Jump King is pretty difficult for me to sit down and play, it's the same problem I have with other games like it. I'm not the guy that gets mad at video games like I used to. But, I'm not a zen master. If I lose a ton of progress that's going to make me not want to continue playing. However, I can tell that Jump King is good and will find the player base that likes it. Anyone who enjoyed Getting Over It needs to play Jump King.
