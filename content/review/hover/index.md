I came across Hover recently and instantly added it to my wishlist. With grinding and tricks, the video looks so smooth. I should have known though. It's nothing like that when you start. The world has a confusing layout and the movement isn't fluid enough for it to accidentally happen.

Is it a multiplayer game? Obviously there's no population to play it so that's unfortunate. But, I don't think adding more people is going to change anything.

The UI is a mess, super colorful for no reason and difficult to navigate.

That's pretty much why I can't continue. I feel like the game portrays itself as a fast parkour runner and my experience hasn't been like that. After a very bad tutorial I've been given a bunch of mission to run through checkpoints. I imagine if you can power through this and get good at the movement system there's a fun game here. However, if after an hour I'm not feeling it then I'm out.

Good music though.
