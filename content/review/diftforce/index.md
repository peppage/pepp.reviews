Driftforce is a pretty simple game to cover. It's a fairly casual endless racing or flying game. It really depends on what you think of those cars or ships. I'm not sure. It's a bit like Race the Sun. Either way, I've been really enjoying trying to fly fast and collect as much score as possible.

However, the issue with Driftforce is that it doesn't help itself out. It fails to explain anything to the player. Yes, I know there's a wall of text on the level select screen. No, I didn't read that the first time I played because why would I? I'm not the type of player to read anything, I gotta get in the game quick and figure it out.

That said, Diftforce is somewhat difficult to figure out. The steering is a little weird. The scoring is a bit odd. Not to mention whatever is on the screen that seems like typical UI but it's actually important information.

Let's start with the driving. It's something you need to get a feel for. I was having a tricky time when I first started but I investigated the options menu for the controls. That's the first place I check if a game is confusing me. Anyway, I noticed there are two ways to control the ship. The mouse turns and the keyboard strafes. Well I jacked up the sensitivity and starting using both at the same time. That was the magical combination that gives you plenty of control. Using only one of those would be a nightmare. I wonder if the complaints from other gamers was because they were only using one. They complained that it drove like a block of ice and I could see that.

Using them together is a bit weird at first but gets easier with practice. It also gives you a lot of control since if you only need to move a little bit the keyboard lets you do that. With practice I was getting a lot better with each run.

Side note, there's a limit to how fast the ship can go. It's not bad since the levels get more complicated and contain more obstacles. Yet, I wonder what it would be like if the game did go faster. I'm certain I could handle it being faster, it would be nice to try.

Moving on to the scoring, which is another confusing part of Driftforce. There are orbs scattered around each level and picking them up starts to create a chain. Once you collect five the score chain is added to your total score. Why five? I have no idea. But what you're meant to do is boost between collecting them to raise the multiplier. The orbs are not all at the same point value, something the game forgets to mention. The score tier is yellow to blue with yellow being the lowest. I'm not going to claim to be an expert here. I'm still trying to figure it out, there has to be something I'm missing too because many other players are able to get a higher score.

Now what you might think is that they stayed on the track longer without dying. Some of them did but not all of them. I'm certain that on a long enough timeline you could get the top score but it gets fast and difficult. It would be tricky to ignore the multiplier and stay alive long enough to get a high score. I believe it comes down to getting that multiplier with boost and learning where all the orbs are. Most runs in the game are under ten minutes, even if it doesn't feel like it. This is about having a quick run and getting as much score as possible.

Alright, on to that UI. The most important parts all live down in the lower left corner. The hull damage is important since you can end up bumping around the track. Sometimes it gets a little bumper cars and you'll have to wrangle the car back under control. So it matters a little until you get good enough where that doesn't happen. However, a head on collision will wreck your car anyway. No matter if you're at 100% hull. Which is fair enough.

Keep in mind that even if you explode the run isn't over. Again, in the lower left is your ship stock. It's the blue lines. So you do get a few chances at continuing the run which is fair since sometimes you're going to make a dumb mistake. Driftforce also gives you more ships if you last long enough in the game. It's the blue orbs you can pick up. This mechanic surprises me though. It does smooth out the experience though and when you're given three chances to make it around one object but you crash into it every time anyway then it's really your own fault.

Side note, I love the crash explosions. They're big and the game slows down so you can really focus on your crash. Reminds me of Burnout.

Anyway, the levels are yet another area where the game is confusing. The main game levels are randomized but are also always the same seed. This means they're not randomized at all. Using the same seed when randomly generating always gives the same result. So the top six levels are seeds one through six. Then there's a random level which can be any seed. The thing is these randomized levels don't feel that different. It's fairly subtle and only becomes apparent after playing them over and over. It feels like they move through the same area progression but have a different layout. What I mean is every time you go through a blue portal the world changes slightly. For example, either inside or snow covered. It feels like the order of those is always the same.

Well there's different online leaderboards for each so it doesn't matter too much. It's also nice to be able to practice a level and memorize pieces of it.

The other level types are similar but let me run through them,

There's track mode it's a random level but you only start with one life. I can't see any other difference.

There's block mode is a fairly normal mode but a lot of boxes are in the way and they keep adding them in.

There's space mode which means you're in space and the obstacles seem like something that would be on a spaceship.

There's narrow mode. Which I can't figure out how anyone actually stays on the track it's so damn narrow.

OK so there's three different choices in ship type, they're all the same mechanically this is more for style. You can also customize the colors a bit. It's nice to have.

Overall, Driftforce is odd and I like it a lot. I'm all about these simple games that make you go fast. It is confusing to start but simple enough that you can pick it up quickly. Flying through the tracks puts me in a stay of flow that is fun, even if I'm not topping the online leaderboards. Although I really want that top spot!
