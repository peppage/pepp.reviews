To tell the truth there isn't a lot to say about Overcome. The game is a straight over the plate platformer. Although they definitely made it difficult.

The shield is the most interesting mechanic because it gets upgrades as you play. Initially it only blocks shots, then it can reflect shots, and finally you get to use it as a parachute. You have to be careful using the shield though because getting hit will knock you back. Which can push you over an edge straight to your death. There's one part in particular I have in mind where the platforms are tight and you need to wait for enemy pathing before you can land safely. Even then you can be knocked off easily.

You see that shield icon in the lower left corner? Yeah that is meaningless. I thought there was going to be some mechanic associated but nope. It looks like it goes down when the shield gets hit but the limit is so high that you've already panicked and died long before it matters. Even taking multiple shots did nothing and it recharges so fast that it doesn't matter. Really strange.

The difficulty is why you would play though. If you're looking for a pretty difficult game that isn't random then this is it. It's about an eighty to eighty five out of a hundred on the difficultly scale I just made up. This isn't as difficult as those other seriously difficult games. Precise jumping and timing will be required. Even with the enemies, making sure that you engage them a specific way is important. Otherwise you won't have time to get your shield into position.

Anyway, the theme is, to quote the dev, "an expression of the developer's experience with cancer and heartbreak." Which makes a lot of sense as you go start off in a monotone level that moves into a fire level. It's very passive and takes a backseat to the mechanics. It's kind of surprising considering how they're using it to sell the game. I mean it's in there if you're looking for it but if they didn't say anything I wouldn't have even questioned it.

So there's one big problem I had with the game, it's that you can't play with a controller. Full controller support sure but they made a mistake and didn't take into account older controllers. You see keyboards are digital input, either the key is pressed or it isn't. However, controller thumbsticks are analogue. Which is why, in some games, the main character will walk vs run depending on how much you move the stick. On my older controller the thumbstick is a bit loose and so the deadzone is larger. The area where it's technically in the middle and not moving. For most games the controller works great which is why I was confused when Overcome was acting up. The heart would move on its own or reverse back the other way and move the shield the wrong way. It was frustrating and I really hope the developer can expand the deadzone

Overall, Overcome doesn't have any of the magic that gets me excited to play games. There's platforming that's really difficult because it's pixel perfect and I can't be perfect all the time. Is that enjoyable? Well... sometimes it can be. When overcoming that difficulty. It takes about an hour and a half to complete with four different levels. It takes that long because the checkpoints are further apart later in the game. Also I might have been pushing myself when I was sleepy so I died a lot then. I'm not recommending this.
