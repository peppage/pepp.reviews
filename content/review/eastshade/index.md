Welcome to Eastshade, a delightful place where everyone is so kind. Hanging out here is comfortable and relaxing. Like a nice cup of warm tea on a chilly Saturday. A genuine and heartfelt game that I loved. I mean the point of the game is to make four paintings for your mother's memory. It just happens that Eastshade is so inviting and a great place to explore.

Eastshade is beautiful! Between the lush forest, frozen mountains, and rocky beaches everything is so nice to look at. They did a great job with the ambient sounds. And every area has something unexpected to find.

Eastshade is an exploration game. All the mechanics feed into this. The player is constantly rewarded for searching every corner of the world. There are no quest markers, no UI elements to send you in any direction. The game does a great job giving you a simple map that doesn't show your location. Be aware there is fast travel but I rarely used it.

It's refreshing, the developers really thought about it and placed plenty of content. Now that can take a few different forms. Weather that's a beautiful vista, a quest, or a locked area. If you look, there will be something that peaks your interest. The view distance is important as well and you can see distant structures that will intrigue you enough to walk over there for a look. For example, if you don't fully explore the forest but make it to Nava. From there looking back to the forest you'll see a hot air balloon. C'mon how do you not go and check out out!?

Here's an example of exploring the town and going down all the way down this path. And finding a locked door and you just wonder what's behind that door. I need to know!

So you're an artist, a painter. The game makes it easy to paint a scene. Pick the framing and away you go, this isn't a painting game. The game handles it all for you which I like. So you're going to be getting a lot of requests to make art. For example, you're tasked with painting a sandy beach to trade for a recipe. With no directions where the sandy beach is you will need to explore the world to find it. Go find that beach!

For example here's me painting the beautiful Nava skyline with this cute couple sitting here enjoying the view. You can easily adjust what size you want the painting to be and then you press a button and it gets painted. Magically it ends up being a beautiful rendition of the scene.

Now, you can't paint whenever you want. You need the inspiration. This is a resource you have to manage in the game but it's not stressful. I like the mechanic because it fits the game but it's unneeded. Still, I can't imagine the game without it. You get more inspiration for finding new areas and reading books. So, it does force the player to seek new areas but if you're playing the game you're going to be doing that.

Anyway, the other part of Eastshade that is great are the inhabitants. The place is full of life and interesting people. No duplicate, boring, stock people. You know how in Elder Scrolls everyone saw a vile mud crab? Well there's none of that here. Which is nice, they didn't feel the need to fill the air with anything but nature sounds. The people are incredibly friendly and with how much voice acting there is in the game, I'm shocked! I can't believe they have so much. I suppose it could have gotten away with only some voice acting but it really helps bring out the characters. Even some of the smaller characters have a couple lines.

So for this tower it's completely locked up. Then you go ask around town about it.

Now it's a mystery to solve!

Even though the people are friendly they can sometimes get confused. The developer programmed enough dialogue but didn't cover all possibilities. I don't fault them, that would be too much and I'm sure too expensive. But if you meet someone out of order it feels weird. A simple example of this is when I met a woman when I first got to then and she told me she heard I was helpful around town. Wut? From who? Tell me names! Being more serious this is such a minor complaint. If it were a AAA title it would get blasted though.

Side note, something I find really funny and I know it's dumb is how I bust into people's homes and take any loose cloth and wood. It's the materials for building a canvas and they're everywhere. But having the person watch me take it and they don't say anything is so funny. I'm the cloth and wood bandit! Probably because in so many other games the police would show up to take me away.

One of the things you'll be doing in Eastshade is crafting. Which requires materials you find around the world. You use this crafting screen to make canvases or a tent!

Anyway, keep in mind that Eastshade is a casual game. There's no way to fail. Even if you're outside when night comes you can't freeze to death. The game politely teleports you back to the last inn to stayed at. Also there's plenty of ways to make money so you can't get stuck. But it's done very well and fits into the game.

If I was going to make a complaint it would have to be about the physics. Sometimes the character auto steps over a rock and things can get weird. Fly up into the air. I've also had an object floating in the air. However, it's very minimal and if this is my biggest complaint then there's nothing to worry about.

Oh and I really wish there was a way to share paintings easier. On Twitter or save a JPEG of it. The game wants you to make extra paintings and I did. But I ended up painting over them because I couldn't hang them to our save them in a meaningful way.

Overall, Eastshade is awesome and I loved it. If your idea of fun is to be dropped in an unknown place and help out around town then this game is for you. Indie games should take note Eastshade raises the bar for exploration games and a level of polish I rarely see. The ending too, really drives home how much heart the developers poured into the game.
